
Probability of Raining = a.humidity + b.temperature + c.sunlight + d

where a, b and c are coefficient and d is intercept

Rain in % = a.Heat + b.Temperature + c.Sunlight + d

We will read Heat, Temperature an Sunlight from sensors,
So we have to find coefficient a,b and c, and intercept d.
